We know that the cutoff price of each auction is decided by the bids. So for one auction there is only one cutoff price. However, that may not reflect the real price of this treasury because the bids are random. So want I did are:
1.	Filter out one bidder, then randomly chose bidders(numpy) left to simulate n times of the fake auction and then calculate the real cutoff price for that chosen bidder. 
2.	create 2000 or more spot with random prices and amounts and put them into the auctions to calculate the times that they can win and then the probability of wining. Then I make a logistic regression model(sk learn) to predict the winning probability and draw the diagram of price and probability. And then predict for every bid and save the information into a csv, first as auction name then as a final csv.
